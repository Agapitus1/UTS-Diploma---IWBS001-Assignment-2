# Assignment 2. Creating Web Pages Using HTML and CSS
 (10 %, due beginning of tutorial week 11)

# Create a Web site based on the following requirements.

All HTML and CSS code required for this assignment must be developed by using Notepad or a similar text based editor. Use of any Web development software, such as Dreamweaver, etc. is not permitted.

# Scenario

# Create your personal web site that includes at least the following three pages:
•	A home page (Providing general information about yourself)
•	A web page that briefly introduces one of your favourite places/cities/areas. This could be a place where you have been or you have dreamed to go.
•	A web page about one of your favourite things that you would like others to appreciate it as you do.
Make a 2-3 minutes video that explains some of your design features.

# Detailed Requirements

(a)	The Home page focuses on yourself and as such must contain:

•	Your photo, name and student ID
•	Some information about yourself as what you want others to know about you. This information may be presented by texts, images and video clips.
•	Hyperlinks to other two pages and your UTS email address.

You must include sections of text and images/animations that are formatted using Cascading Style Sheets.  The contents could describe your education/employment background, your life, hobbies, sporting activities, or any other topic you like to tell others about you. The contents can be factual or fabrication. The aim of this section is for you to demonstrate your skills of presenting/organising contents and CSS competence. Therefore you must include the following CSS as a minimum:

•	An external CSS file that contains at least
o	A style that formats all paragraph tags
o	A generic class definition that is used somewhere on the web page
o	A class that is specific to a particular tag
o	A style that formats a text heading
This CSS file must be inked to the home page.
•	Embedded style that defines the following
o	 An id selector that applies to an H1 tag
o	A contextual style 
o	A class to format anchor tag hyperlinks (hover event)
•	Multiple In-line styles

(b)	The Favourite Place page must include sections of texts describing the place, such as people, scenery, culture, food, etc. and the reasons why you like it, with some pictures showing the beauty of the place. It must have links to Internet web sites where further information about the place can be obtained. Some of such links should be reached by clicking on some pictures. It should be specific to the place, such as a city, town, village or an area, but not about a country in general. 

It must have the links to other two pages. The external CSS file used in the home page should be applied to this page as well.

(c)	The Favourite Thing page contains the description of the thing, and the reasons why you like it. The examples of the thing could be a mobile phone, an iPad, a game, a book, a music instrument, a bicycle, a car, a camera, a toy, a tool, etc. You must present a thing, not an activity. Images and/or animations should be used to make the webpage more attractive and interesting. Reference links to Internet websites for further information are required. It must have the links to other two pages. Define your own embedded CSS styles to decorate this page. The minimum requirements for CSS styles are:
•	At least one group style for two or more tags
•	At least one CSS class
•	At least one contextual style (CSS style applied to a tag within another tag)
•	An hover style applied to <a> tag.
And multiple in-line CSS styles.

(d)	     In the video, you should explain some features used in your web pages. These include:
•	Two HTML tags in your web pages, their functions and the reasons why you use them
•	Two CSS styles used in your web pages, their functions and why you use them

# Marking Criteria

Marking of the assessment is based on the fulfilment of the above requirements, the design of the web site interfaces, the richness of the contents included and your English writing skills. Extensive use of CSS beyond the above minimum requirements is encouraged and would achieve better grades.

Please refer to Assignment 2-Marking criteria on Canvas for more information.

# Submission

Save all web pages, CSS style files and other related files (images, multimedia, etc.) in a folder, and compress the folder and the video file into a zip file. Submit the zip file to Canvas before the beginning of your tutorial class in week 11. 

The zip file name must include your name and student ID.
