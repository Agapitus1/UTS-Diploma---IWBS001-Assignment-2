Hello! It's a pleasure to meet you!
My name is Agapitus Hendry Soputeranto,
and to make you all easier, just call me as Hendry.
This year I am 18 years old and going to be 19 on next March. 
Right now I stay in Semarang, a city located in Indonesia.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
My status right now is a university student in <a href="https://www.uts.edu.au/">University of Technology Sidney</a> <img width="50" height="20" src="UTS.png">.
I am now in the diploma of IT and learn from Semarang using remote learning.
I actually really hate this online learning, but the condition force me to do this kind of thing.
I could not do anything about it, and I hope the covid-19 could end up really soon!
Pray the best for all of us and especially for the medical personnel that work hard for us!</p>

<h2 class="dua" >Hobbies & Activities </h2>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Talking about hobby, I have several hobbies that I love to do it.
I love playing game, travelling, watching movie, and photography-videography as one of my favourite.
One of my favourite games is DOTA 2, which you could get <a href="https://www.dota2.com/play/">here</a>. I have been playing this game for almost 5 years.
In fact, I play this game even from the series before the DOTA 2, which is DOTA.

<h2 class="dua" >Sport</h2>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Do I like sport ? Yes, of course I do! My favourite sport is football.
I do not know why, but I love this sport. First time I knew this sport was when the World Cup 2010.
WC 2010 is the most epic WC I have ever seen! 
The atmosphere went crazy and there were many star player played.
The other football competition which I loved is UEFA Champions League. 
This competition is also having great atmosphere, that we could even feell it only from listen the anthem. 
The anthem is amazing! Here I give the anthem to feel how epic is the competition!
